## Overview

This is a simple library for generating quasi-random shapes in the plane of
specified complexity and smoothnes.

The shape boundary is represented as a loop (an array) of cubic bezier curves.

## Installation
```cli
npm install generate-random-shapes
```

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
It can be used in `Node.js` or in a browser.

## Usage

In addition to `generateRandomShape` the following convenience functions are also exported:

* `pointsToShape`
* `pointsToSimplePolygon`
* `setShapeSmoothness`
* `moveShapeCentroidToOrigin`
* `setShapeSize`
* `setShapeRotation`

### Node.js
```js
import { generateRandomShape } from 'generate-random-shapes';

const shape = generateRandomShape(0, 5, 1);
console.log(shape);  //=> [[[-0.2372092174828731, -0.6962315314077125], [-0.444758140717...
// ...
```

### Browsers - directly, without a bundler, using the pre-bundled minified .js file

```html
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <script type="module">
        import { generateRandomShape } from './node_modules/generate-random-shapes/browser/index.min.js';

        const shape = generateRandomShape(0, 5, 1);
        console.log(shape);  //=> [[[-0.2372092174828731, -0.6962315314077125], [-0.444758140717...
        // ...
    </script>
</head>

<body>Check the console.</body>

</html>
```

### Bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, ...)

Webpack will be taken as an example here. 

Since your webpack config file might still use `CommonJS` you must rename 
`webpack.config.js` to `webpack.config.cjs`.

If you are using TypeScript:

Since this is an [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)
library you must use [resolve-typescript-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-typescript-plugin) 
in your `webpack.config.cjs` file.

```cli
npm install --save-dev resolve-typescript-plugin
```

and follow the instructions given at [resolve-typescript-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-typescript-plugin).

Additionally, follow this [guide](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c#how-can-i-make-my-typescript-project-output-esm).
